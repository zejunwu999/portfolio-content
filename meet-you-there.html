	<h2>Website event portal design for Chadsey-Condon Community Organization</h2>
	</header>

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>Chadsey-Condon Community Organization (CCCO) is a Detroit, Michigan-based non-profit organization. 
		CCCO hosts events around neighborhoods and interacts with residents in their areas to build a better 
		community. The current event information presentation is not integrated and the event organization 
		process at CCCO is time-consuming. Internal stakeholders, residents, and external partners are 
		having difficulty obtaining all previous and upcoming event information in one place.</p>

		<h2>Solution: An event portal on the current website</h2>
		<p>With the project scope and our client vision, we designed an event portal on their current 
			website to help the community improve the event-related information display and event sign-up 
			process as well as to strengthen the relationships with residents and partners.</p>
