		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Neuroscience is a subject interesting to explore and important to the studies of 
			many other fields as well. However, the beginning of neuroscience study can be 
			somewhat hard. Unlike subjects such as math or computer science, students see 
			algebra, shapes, or codes exactly as they are on textbooks or desktop screens. 
			The neuroscience theories can be abstract and difficult to understand, especially 
			for starters, because people cannot see what takes place in the brain.</p>

		<h2>Solution: VR experience for neuroscience education</h2>

		<h2>Key Interactions</h2>

		<img src = "images/nj-interaction2.png" width="200" alt="The key interaction 2 of the design: travelling in the brain."/>
		<img src = "images/nj-interaction3.png" width="200" alt="The key interaction 3 of the design: neuron activated and colors changed."/>
		<img src = "images/nj-interaction4.png" width="200" alt="The key interaction 4 of the design: neuron transmitters' movements."/>

		<p>The reason why I choose VR to solve the problem: neuroscience can be hard, abstract, 
			and not appealing because people cannot see what takes place in the brain. What is 
			different from other VR products with the topic of brain/neuron trips: I will pay 
			more attention to the journey process for education, and try to create more chances 
			for interactions to let users be more engaged.</p>
