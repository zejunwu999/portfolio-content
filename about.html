		<h2>Hi, I'm Zejun.</h2>

		<img src = "images/about-headshot.png" width="200" alt="Zejun's personal photo"/>
		
		<p>I am a graduate student studying human-computer interaction at the University of 
			Michigan. Previously, I studied advertising at Zhejiang University and had internship 
			experience in a technology company and a brand design agency.</p>

		<p>I enjoy figuring out the inner needs of users, thinking about their behaviors, and 
			telling stories that will touch them, previously through advertising and marketing 
			campaigns and now through my design. I have a strong passion for solving problems 
			for people, and I believe design is the path that fits me.</p>
		
		<p>Through my ten-year experience of art learning, I developed the love to create and to 
			form new ideas, while through my academic studies I developed the habits of thinking 
			analytically and following the right process to reach the outcome.</p>
